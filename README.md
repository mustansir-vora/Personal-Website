# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

## About

This is a single-page, responsive portfolio website designed to showcase my skills and experience as a software developer. The website features a dynamic day-night cycle that changes as the user scrolls, creating an engaging and visually appealing experience.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Day/Night Cycle:** The background and text colors transition smoothly from sunrise to sunset and into the night as the user scrolls down the page.
*   **Interactive Sun/Moon:** A celestial object (sun/moon) moves across the sky, its position and color changing with the time of day.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links provide smooth scrolling to different sections of the page.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
*   **Contact Section:** Includes links to my email, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as a downloadable resume.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and the dynamic day/night theme.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first CSS styling.
*   **JavaScript:** For the interactive features, including the scrolling animations and color transitions.

## How to Use

## Customization
